# Advanced_TicTacToe

This was my project for Computer Science 114 which is the module I had in my 1st 1ear in the first semester.
This is my first ever project I have done in Java which I am really impressed of and got good marks for the submission (+- 85%)
I wouldve liked to have less lines of code and some parts are a bit janky expecially the algorithm that checks for winning states on the gameboard.
Using a 3D array for the gameboard was quite the learning experience as we only covered up until 2D arrays in java.
So I had to figure out on my own how to use a 3D array and transfer strings inside the array as pieces covered other pieces.
10/10 Was a good experience coding until 2 in the morning. Would do it again.
